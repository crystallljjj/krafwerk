In this Amazon Coupon dataset, I focused on analyzing the "Coffee" and "bar" coupon.

The conclusion is:

  The people, who is under 30,used to go to bar more than once a month and with no kids in car, would be more possible to accept the bar coupon.
  
  The people, who is under 25,used to go to coffee house more than once a month and with passenger in car not alone and were not widowed, would be more possible to accept the bar coupon. 
  
The analyzing notebook is located at https://github.com/crystallljjj/krafwerk/blob/main/prompt.ipynb.

There is also a report on "coupon_analysis.pptx".
